Role: You are a senior frontend engineer building a simple, static website (no backend) that matches the Part-1 Design Proposal for “Exploring Singapore’s Green Gems.”

You may search the web to find accurate info and open-licensed images. Prefer official/authoritative sources (e.g., NParks) and Creative Commons images. Cite all sources on the Credits page. If license is unclear, use a placeholder image and only link to the source.

1) Goals

Produce a static, accessible, responsive 6-page site with consistent header (nav boxes) and footer.

Fill each page with concise, paraphrased content from reputable sources; no copy-paste of copyrighted text.

Include both a static map image and a Google Maps link for each park on the Directions page (use open-licensed map imagery or placeholders if licensing is unclear).

2) Pages (exact names & order)

index.html → Home

finder.html → Finder

directions.html → Directions

scenic.html → Scenic

safety.html → Safety

credits.html → Credits

Header (right-side 6 boxes): Home | Finder | Directions | Scenic | Safety | Credits
Footer: “Made by Team” and “Contact us” (link to Credits)

3) Parks (use this exact set & order everywhere)

MacRitchie Reservoir

Bukit Timah Nature Reserve

Rail Corridor (central)

Coney Island

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve

Labrador Nature Reserve

4) Visual system (tokens)

Colors: Light green #A8D5A2, Beige #F5E8D0, Accent dark green #2E7D32, Text #1F2937

Font: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif

Layout: Header → Main → Footer on every page

Accessibility: WCAG-friendly contrast, focus styles, skip-to-content link, alt text for all images

5) Page requirements

Home (simple 2 blocks over nature background)

Short purpose statement + “What you can do here” line.

Background: open-licensed nature image or placeholder; include alt text.

Finder (single page split into 6 sections)

One section per park with: 1-sentence overview, Difficulty (Easy/Moderate/Hard), Duration (e.g., “45–90 min”), Amenities (toilets/water/shelters).

Use anchor IDs (#macritchie, etc.) and “Back to top” links.

Directions (single page split into 6 sections)

Per park: brief MRT/Bus/Car description (paraphrased) +

a static map image (open-licensed or placeholder) and

a Google Maps link to the trail/park entrance.

Include alt text like “Route from nearest MRT to MacRitchie.”

Scenic (single page split into 6 sections)

Per park: 1–2 scenic highlights, optional YouTube link (no autoplay audio), optional map trail link.

Safety (two columns)

Left: safety & etiquette bullets, weather reminder, packing checklist (water, sun/rain gear, basic first-aid).

Right: illustrative image (open-licensed or placeholder) with alt text.

Credits (and Contact)

Team names (you can leave placeholders).

References list: link and name of each source used (NParks pages, YouTube, Google Maps, images).

Contact/Feedback form (Name, Email, Message) — non-functional (e.g., action="#").

6) File structure
/green-gems/
  index.html
  finder.html
  directions.html
  scenic.html
  safety.html
  credits.html
  /assets/
    /images/   (open-licensed or placeholders)
    /icons/
  /styles/
    main.css   (external stylesheet for all pages)
  /content/
    sources.json     (list of citations with titles+URLs+license)
    parks.json       (the six parks’ data used to fill sections)
  README.md

7) Data you must gather via web search

For each park: short overview (1–2 sentences), difficulty, duration, amenities, transport (nearest MRT/bus, brief driving note), 1 scenic highlight, map link.

Store structured facts in content/parks.json.

Record all source URLs + image licenses in content/sources.json and list them on Credits.

8) Build guidance

No frameworks; vanilla HTML/CSS; minimal JS for smooth scroll and “back to top.”

Reuse a common header and footer snippet across pages (copy/paste is fine for this assignment).

CSS: build tokens (colors, spacing, font sizes). Ensure responsive behavior for mobile (single column) and desktop.

If an image’s license is unclear, use a neutral placeholder and place a source link only.

9) Quality gates (don’t skip)

All six pages exist; nav works both ways; section anchors work.

Consistent park order across Finder, Directions, Scenic.

All images have alt text; text is legible (≥16px); keyboard focus visible.

Lighthouse (or similar) quick pass ≥90 for Best Practices/Accessibility on localhost.

credits.html lists all sources + image/clip attributions; include one-line AI acknowledgement.

10) Deliverables

Complete project folder as above.

README.md with:

how to open locally

how content was sourced (summary)

known limitations for Part-1 prototype

Brief change log at end of README (what you generated).

Start now. Ask clarifying questions only if something blocks progress; otherwise proceed using best judgment consistent with this PRD.
